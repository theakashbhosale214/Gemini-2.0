Built a Generative AI App using Google Gemini API with React JS

This project utilizes a combination of web development technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs (specifically the Google Gemini API), and the React library for building user interfaces.

Description:

  I've created a Gemini-inspired application that leverages React for the user interface (UI) and seamlessly integrates with the Gemini 
  API to generate responses to user queries. Similar to Gemini, you can enter any question or prompt, and the app will dynamically 
  generate a response based on its understanding and capabilities.
  
  The app offers a user-friendly interface with the following key features:
  
  A)Sidebar: The sidebar serves two purposes:
  
   a)Recent Searches: You can conveniently access your recent search history, streamlining navigation and revisiting past interactions.
   b)New Prompt: A dedicated section within the sidebar allows you to easily initiate a new interaction, providing a fresh starting point 
                for your exploration with the AI.
  
  B)Dashboard: The dashboard is designed for:
  
   a)Suggestions: The dashboard might provide suggestions like brainstorming techniques or related topics to help you refine your queries.
   b)Results: The dashboard serves as the primary area where the AI's generated responses are prominently displayed, providing you with 
              the information or insights you seek.
